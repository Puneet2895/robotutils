/**
 * Implementation of the Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm, a graph search algorithm that
 * computes single-source shortest paths in a weighted directed graph.
 *
 * If a graph contains a "negative cycle", i.e., a cycle whose edges sum to a
 * negative value, then walks of arbitrarily low weight can be constructed and
 * there can be no shortest path. Bellman-Ford can detect negative cycles and
 * report their existence, but it cannot produce a correct answer.
 *
 * This implementation implements a single-query variant, in which the shortest
 * path between two nodes is computed, and no information is retained for
 * subsequent queries.
